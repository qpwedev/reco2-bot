## Built With

- Node.js: Powers our server-side application, managing tasks like database interactions and API interfacing.
- React: Used for our client-side application, creating an interactive user interface.
- SQL Database: Manages data, including user information and transaction records.
- Telegram & MetaMask APIs: Enable integration with the Telegram messaging platform and non-custodial wallet management respectively.

The most significant challenge was developing a shop interface using the latest Telegram technology that interacts with non-custodial wallets. Coordinating different parts, such as fetching product data, displaying products, managing wallet transactions, while ensuring user-friendliness and security was complex.
